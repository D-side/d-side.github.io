I'll keep it simple: I have no ways of direct interaction with this site visitors only but using of 3rd-party services, such as AddThis and Disqus, which are connected to this website, but are not built or installed into it. These services have their own privacy policies and it's for the best that I don't include them here. It's better to see an up-to-date version. As for my own privacy policy &mdash; read along.

The basics are: these services only store and share your personal information with your permission. The only information connected to specific users is visible to me in Disqus, that includes emails, IP addresses and Disqus nicknames: just enough data to be able to blacklist certain users from commenting here. All this is covered by Disqus privacy policy I disclose none of the personal data I have access through Disqus to to 3rd parties, still, you may want to look up what Disqus intends to do with your data in their privacy policy.

As for the website: it only uses cookies in order to remember which style did you select for this site (<i class="icon-adjust"> </i> above). While this information might get exchanged with the service that hosts this site (Github Pages), it is not able to process that information in any way, since this site is static and not programmable on the server side at all. Therefore, I can't determine which users have which style set. Moreover, I can't even gather any data on which style is used more frequently.

### Why bother?

Because I care about privacy. Actually, there is a law in the EU that requires website owners to warn users of cookie usage, in case the website actually uses them. But it's not the primary factor.

### What are these "cookies" anyway?

It's a way of remembering little bits of text on the user's machine and exchanging them with a website. Cookies are bound to sites they were issued on, and can't be used elsewhere.

Most often it's used for authentication. When you enter your login and password, the server issues and gives you a token, some sort of a temporary proof that it's actually you. That cookie is sent to you through the HTTP headers ("preambles" of pages your browser loads) and stored in your browser. Later on, the browser sends this token with each request to the issuing site, in order to be recognised as you, the logged-in user. And that's only one example of usage.

There are several attack vectors that use cookies. Stealing cookies in order to fool authentication system is most common. Therefore, one needs to know if his personal data can be compromised by obtaining your cookie.

What do I do with that? A much more simple thing only your browser knows about: each time you flick the switch above, a cookie is saved (or overwritten) saying what current color scheme you last used. On page load, that cookie is read by a piece of JavaScript (that works in your browser if it's on) and an appropriate color scheme is enabled depending on what's written there.

### No, I don't want your "cookies", please keep them away

I can't remove the cookie-based functionality from my websites, it's too convenient. And I haven't heard any complaints from my visitors about them.
