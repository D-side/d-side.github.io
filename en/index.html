<p>Seen any of these names? That was probably me. I'm a software developer (preferring web and games), I've been sort of a "community manager" in several gaming communities, right now I'm working on my own project.</p>
<p>I try to describe here most of the ways I use to gain experience so that my path can be followed by the others. Sometimes I answer the questions about the tools I use, not every single question though. If you've got one, see "Contacts" page.</p>
<p>One of these links may be helpful if you're looking for something specific here. The problem is, that I only write my blog posts in russian (since most of my readers and myself speak russian, but not english). So there's no blog here.</p>
